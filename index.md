# Create your own webpage using GitHub pages

#### In this assignment you will: 
* Make a `GitHub` account
* Create a new **repository** in `GitHub`
* Build a **webpage** using `GitHub pages`
* Learn how to use `Markdown` and `HTML`

For this first assignment, you're going to create a personal webpage using <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">**GitHub pages**</a> and <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/" target="_blank">**Markdown**</a>. You'll use this webpage to add some biographical information and a photo of yourself. Throughout this internship, you'll be updating your webpage with links to assignments (spring), team project progess (summer), and other work that you'll complete (throughout). 

> While not required for this first assignment, you can read more about `git` and `GitHub` in our open <a href="https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/git-github/" target="_blank">**Earth Data Science**</a> textbook.

### Step 0: Create a GitHub account
Use <a href="https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home" target="_blank">**this link**</a> to create an GitHub account. _**If you already have a GitHub account, there is no need to create a new account!**_

> **Protip:** Your GitHub <a href="https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html" target="_blank">**username**</a> should be short but something that you can easily identify with.

***

### Step 1: Create a new repository

Once you have a GitHub account, get started by creating a new **repository** for your webpage. There are several ways to accomplish this task. One way is to go to your profile page on GitHub and select the **Repositories** tab from the menu near the top of the page.

> **NOTE:** A repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history. You can discuss and manage your project's work within the repository.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cu-esiil-edu/esiil-stars-student-webpages/main/images/repositories.png">

From here, you can select the green **New** button on the right to get started.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cu-esiil-edu/esiil-stars-student-webpages/main/images/new-repo.png">

Give your new repository a name that is descriptive so you can easily search for it later on. 

Something like `username-esiil-stars-webpage` would be appropriate.

* You can give your repository a **description**
* Make your repository **Public**
* Check the box to add a `README` file to your repository (you will edit this later using **Markdown**)
* You can skip adding the **gitignore** for now
* Choose a **License** for your repository
* Once you're done, select the green **Create Repository** button at the bottom of the page

***

### Step 2: Create a new `index.md` file
You will create a new file called `index.md` that will serve as the landing page for the content for your webpage. To do this you can :
* Select the **Add file** button from the menu on the right
* Select **Create new file**. 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cu-esiil-edu/esiil-stars-student-webpages/main/images/create-new-file.png">

From here you will create a new **Markdown** file called `index.md`. 

Add the following Markdown text to this file:
`## ADD YOUR NAME HERE`

***

### Step 3: Commit changes
Now that you've created your `index.md` file and added some text, you'll want to **commit changes** to your repository. Add an optional extended description of your changes and then select the green **Commit changes** button at the bottom of the page.

***

### Step 4: Build and deploy your webpage
Once you've created your `index.md` file you're ready to build and deploy your webpage. From your repository, select the **Settings** tab from right end of the menu. 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cu-esiil-edu/esiil-stars-student-webpages/main/images/settings.png">

From here, scroll down the menu on the **left** and select **Pages**.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cu-esiil-edu/esiil-stars-student-webpages/main/images/pages.png">

Now you'll want to select the **main** option under the **Branch** heading and then select **Save**.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cu-esiil-edu/esiil-stars-student-webpages/main/images/select-branch-main.png">

***

### Step 5: Check on your webpage
Check in on your webpage to see how it is doing by opening the link `https://username.github.io/repository-name/` in a **new tab** in your web browser. Here, you'll need to replace `username` with your GitHub username and `repository-name` with the name of the repository that you created above.

> **NOTE:** Sometimes your webpage can take a minute or so to build so _be patient_ and refresh your page every 30 seconds or so until the page is done building.


***

### Step 6: Add some additional information to your webpage
Now you're ready to start adding some more information to your webpage. Navigate back to your repository and open the `index.md` file that you just created. You will edit this page by clicking on the **pencil** icon on the right of the menu near the top of repository page on GitHub. 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cu-esiil-edu/esiil-stars-student-webpages/main/images/edit-file.png">

Here you should think about adding the following information to your webpage:
* A professional headshot image of yourself
* Your name (as a header)
* A bulleted list of links to your public contact information (email, GitHub account, LinkedIn account, social media accounts, etc.)
* The name of the school that you attend; your year; your major
* What you're excited about learning as an ESIIL Stars intern


> **NOTE:** You will want to review the <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/" target="_blank">**Markdown Basic Syntax guide**</a> to help you format your webpage using **`Markdown`** and **`HTML`**. We also have a <a href="https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/file-formats/use-text-files/format-text-with-markdown-jupyter-notebook/" target="_blank">**lesson**</a> in our **Earth Data Science** textbook that may be helpful.
>
> When adding <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp" target="_blank">**links**</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp" target="_blank">**images**</a> to your webpage, you may appreciate the added control of Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) over Markdown. 
>
> Get creative here! Add some fun and interesting things about yourself. Pictures of pets are also always a major bonus! Anything you want to add here to help tell your story, please go ahead.


**IMPORTANT:** Always remember to **commit changes** so that your updated content gets added to your webpage.

***

### Step 7: Post a link to your webpage on Discourse
Once you're all done you can post a link to your new webpage on the course Discourse page <a href="https://earthlab.earthdatascience.org/c/esiil-stars/esiil-stars-student-webpages/25" target="_blank">**here**</a>.
* Create a new topic (see the **`+New Topic`** button in the upper right)
* Give your topic a **descriptive name**
* Share a link to your **webpag**e and to the **repository** your created
* **Review** the webpages posted by your ESIIL Stars colleagues
* **Reply** to some of your classmates' posts and **tag them in your responses**. Ask them questions, or give them feedback, based their webpage or code (things they’re interested in; things they hope to get out of this internship; areas that you can collaborate; common interests; questions about their code; etc.)

> #### Don't forget to add a link to your new webage to your resumé or CV! Or, think about how your could turn your resumé _**into**_ a webpage.
